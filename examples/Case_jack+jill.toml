Description = "This example aims to demonstrate some of Owl's capabilities. Jack and Jill are a married couple a few years from retirement. A wages and contributions file called 'jack+jill.xlsx' is associated with this case. This case uses the historical rate sequence of 1969 as a test case for guiding spending amounts from a near worst-case historical scenario. This case also demonstrates that the optimal strategy for Roth conversions does not necessarily involve surfing a tax bracket.  \nA good exercise for learning Owl's capabilities is to duplicate this case and compare two scenarios: one with optimized Roth conversions and one without. Another possible exercise could involve comparing a historical retirement in 1969 vs. one taken in 1966. Or anything else you can think of..."
