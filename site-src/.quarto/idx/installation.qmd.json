The `build` module will be required\nfor developers. You will also need `git` to manage the source code from GitHub\nwhich is found [here](https://git-scm.com/install/windows) for Windows,\nand by installing developer tools on MacOS and Linux.\n\n\nA good option for a comprehensive Python environment is to use the *Anaconda* distribution\nthat can be found [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/) for various operating systems.\nInstallation of *Anaconda* can be done by downloading and running the installation\nfile corresponding to your operating system and hardware.\n\nInstructions given here are command-line instructions to be entered from a terminal window.\n\nIf using *Anaconda*, `pip` can be installed as follows\n```\nconda install pip\n```\notherwise, your distribution will most likely include `pip` already.\n\nThe `build` module is included in *Anaconda*.\nCommand `pip install build` will install it in other distributions.\n\n## Creating a virtual environment\n\nIt is common practice to create a virtual environment for a specific project.\nThis is to avoid making changes in the base ditribution that could break dependencies.\nCreating and activating a new environment called *owlenv* in *Anaconda*\nis achieved by the following commands: \n```\nconda create --name owlenv\nconda activate owlenv\n```\nA cheat sheet for *Anaconda* can be found\n[here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html).\n\nWhen not using `conda`, creating and activating an environment can be done by\nusing the module `venv` as follows:\n```\npython -m venv owlenv\n```\nThis will create subdirectory *owlenv* in the current directory.\nFor activating this environment:\n```\n# in MS command\n.\\owlenv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n\n# in MS PowerShell\n./owlenv/Scripts/activate.ps1\n\n# MacOS or Linux\nsource ./owlenv/Scripts/activate\n```\nMore details on how to create a virtual environment using *venv* can be found\n[here](https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv).\n\n## Obtaining Owl's source code\n\nWe assume that you have created and activated a virtual environment\nat this point. From there, we install the latest version of Owl from GitHub.\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/mdlacasse/Owl.git\n\n```\nThen go (`cd`) to the directory where you installed Owl.\n```\ncd Owl\n```\nFrom the top directory of the source code run:\nThe following command will install the current version of Owl and all its dependencies:\n```shell\npip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt\n```\nYou can also install the Owl package directly from the [Python Package Index](http://pypi.org).\n\n## Running the Streamlit frontend locally\n\nOnce Owl's source code and all its dependencies as been installed,\none can run the Owl user interface locally:\n```shell\n# From Windows\n./owlplanner.cmd\n\n# From MacOS or Linux\n./owlplanner.sh\n```\nThis will open a tab on your default browser.\n\n## Installation steps for developers\n\nFirst use the same steps as above to create and activate a virtual environment\nand install the source code from GitHub.\nThen make sure that the `build` module is installed (`pip install build`).\n\nThe next commands will build and install the Owl module in \"edit mode\"\n```shell\npython -m build\npip install -e .\n```\nThe -e instructs `pip` to install in *editable* mode and use the live version\nin the current directory tree.\n\n## Publishing a version (for reference only)\n\nRun checks before all commits:\n```\nflake8 ui src tests\npytest\n```\nTo update version, edit number in `src/owlplanner/version.py`.\n\nTo update package on pypi or testpypi,\n\n```shell\nrm dist/*\npython -m build\ntwine upload --repository [repo] dist/*\n```\nwhere [repo] is *testpypi* or *pypi* depending on the type of release.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## About\n\nThis document is aimed at software developers desiring to install the Owl source code\nand run it locally on their computer.\n\nFor end-users, we suggest accessing Owl from the\n[Streamlit Community Server](http://owlplanner.streamlit.app)\nor, if one prefers to have everything on their own computer,\nto install and run a Docker image as described in these [instructions](https://github.com/mdlacasse/OWL/docker/README.md).\n\n## Requirements\n\nYou will need a Python environment, and the `pip` module installed on your\ncomputer for completing the installation.
