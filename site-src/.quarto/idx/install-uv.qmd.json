{"title":"Installation - OWL using UV on WSL","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Installation - OWL using UV on WSL"},"headingText":"Requirements","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nThis installation guide uses the [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) family of tools to install [OWL](https://github.com/mdlacasse/OWN).\n\nThis installation guide assumes that you're working with the code using WSL/Ubuntu (Windows Subsystem for Linux, Ubuntu distro).  Separate guides are available for [Conda on Powershell](installation.qmd) and UV on powershell.\n\nThis installation guide is OPINIONATED.\n\nTo use this guide, copy/paste the blocks of code below directly into a WSL terminal.  Hover your mouse over any `code block` and a clipboard icon should appear.  Clicking the clipboard will copy the block of code for pasting into a WSL terminal.\n\n\nThe following code ensures that you've got all the necessary underlying tools.  Copy/paste into a WSL terminal.  The code is intended to install missing tools.  These commands should not negatively impact any tools already installed.\n\n### Install / verify WSL tools\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install make\nsudo apt install git\nsudo apt install gh\nsudo apt install curl\n```\n\n### Install UV\n\nUV is a very fast tool that combines many tools into a single framework.  UV manages python versions (like pyenv), virtual environments (like venv), modules (like pip), packaging (like setuptools), and does it very fast.  UV is a replacement for other tools like `conda`, `pyenv` and `poetry`.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend switching to UV when using OWL.\n\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nUV offers a very extensive list of installation options and optional tools.  See the [UV install guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)\n\n### Testing the tools\n\nIf everything is all set, the following block of commands should run without errors.\n\n```bash\nmake --version\ngit --version\ngh --version\ncurl --version\nuv --version\n```\n\n## Installing OWL\n\nWith the backup tools installed, we can now install OWL and get it running locally.\n\nI keep my GITHUB projects in a local projects folder under my personal home directory.  The following\nblock of code will clone the `owlplanner` project under your `~/projects` project folder.\n\n```bash\ncd ~/projects\ngit clone https://github.com/mdlacasse/Owl.git owlplanner\ncd owlplanner\nuv sync\n```\n\n## Running OWL\n\nThe following command starts the streamlit server on your local computer and automatically opens\na chromium browser.  You're ready to go!\n\n*Note:* this command assumes that your in the project root directory: `~/projects/owlplanner` if you've been following along.\n\n```bash\nuv run python -m streamlit run ./ui/main.py \\\n  --browser.gatherUsageStats=false \\\n  --browser.serverAddress=localhost \\\n  --browser.serverPort=8501\n```\n\n*NOTE:* There are TWO things going on at the same time:\n\n1. A streamlit webserver running from the terminal,\n2. A web browser started up, too, and is probably blocking you from seeing your terminal.\n\nClosing the browser *DOES NOT* close the streamlit web server.  If you close the browser, streamlit is still running.\n\nYou need to enter *CTRL-C* in the terminal to kill/close streamlit.  THIS IS NORMAL!\n\n\n## Updating OWL\n\nOWL is under active development.  You'll want to work with the latest changes.  The command below will\nfetch the latest changes to your local machine and update the libraries.  You can then use the command above to run these changes.\n\n```bash\ngit fetch\nuv sync\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThis installation guide uses the [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) family of tools to install [OWL](https://github.com/mdlacasse/OWN).\n\nThis installation guide assumes that you're working with the code using WSL/Ubuntu (Windows Subsystem for Linux, Ubuntu distro).
