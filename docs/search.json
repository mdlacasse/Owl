    "text": "An example of Owl’s functionality\nWith about 10 lines of Python code, one can generate a full case study. Here is a typical plan with some comments. A plan starts with the names of the individuals, their birth years and life expectancies, and a name for the plan. Dollar amounts are in k$ (i.e. thousands) and ratios in percentage.\nimport owlplanner as owl\n# Jack was born in 1962 and expects to live to age 89. Jill was born in 1965 and hopes to live to age 92.\n# Plan starts on Jan 1st of this year.\nplan = owl.Plan(['Jack', 'Jill'], [1962, 1965], [89, 92], 'jack & jill - tutorial', startDate='01-01')\n# Jack has $90.5k in a taxable investment account, $600.5k in a tax-deferred account and $70k from 2 tax-free accounts.\n# Jill has $60.2k in her taxable account, $150k in a 403b, and $40k in a Roth IRA.\nplan.setAccountBalances(taxable=[90.5, 60.2], taxDeferred=[600.5, 150], taxFree=[50.6 + 20, 40.8])\n# An Excel file contains 2 tabs (one for Jill, one for Jack) describing anticipated wages and contributions.\nplan.readContributions('jack+jill.xlsx')\n# Jack will glide an s-curve for asset allocations from a 60/40 -&gt; 70/30  stocks/bonds portfolio.\n# Jill will do the same thing but is a bit more conservative from 50/50 -&gt; 70/30 stocks/bonds portfolio.\nplan.setInterpolationMethod('s-curve')\nplan.setAllocationRatios('individual', generic=[[[60, 40, 0, 0], [70, 30, 0, 0]], [[50, 50, 0, 0], [70, 30, 0, 0]]])\n# Jack has no pension, but Jill will receive $10k per year at 65 yo.\nplan.setPension([0, 10.5], [65, 65])\n# Jack anticipates receiving social security of $28.4k at age 70, and Jill $19.7k at age 62. All values are in today's $.\nplan.setSocialSecurity([28.4, 19.7], [70, 62])\n# Instead of a 'flat' profile, we select a 'smile' spending profile, with 60% needs for the survivor.\nplan.setSpendingProfile('smile', 60)\n# We will reproduce the historical sequence of returns starting in year 1969.\nplan.setRates('historical', 1969)\n# Jack and Jill want to leave a bequest of $500k, and limit Roth conversions to $100k per year.\n# Jill's 403b plan does not support in-plan Roth conversions.\n# We solve for the maximum net spending profile under these constraints.\nplan.solve('maxSpending', options={'maxRothConversion': 100, 'bequest': 500, 'noRothConversions': 'Jill'})\nThe output can be seen using the following commands that display various plots of the decision variables in time.\nplan.showNetSpending()\nplan.showGrossIncome()\nplan.showTaxes()\nplan.showSources()\nplan.showAccounts()\nplan.showAssetDistribution()\n...\nBy default, all these plots are in nominal dollars. To get values in today’s $, a call to\nplan.setDefaultPlots('today')\nwould change all graphs to report in today’s dollars. Each plot can also override the default by setting the value parameters to either nominal or today, such as in the following example, which shows the taxable ordinary income over the duration of the plan, along with inflation-adjusted extrapolated tax brackets. Notice how the optimized income is surfing the boundaries of tax brackets.\nplan.showGrossIncome(value='nominal')\n\nThe optimal spending profile is shown in the next plot (in today’s dollars). Notice the drop (recall we selected 60% survivor needs) at the passing of the first spouse.\nplan.showProfile('today')\n\nThe following plot shows the account balances in nominal value for all savings accounts owned by Jack and Jill. It was generated using\nplan.showAccounts(value='nominal')\n\nwhile this plot shows the complex cash flow from all sources, which was generated with\nplan.showSources(value='nominal')\n\nFor taxes, the following call will display Medicare premiums (including Part B IRMAA fees) and federal income tax\nplan.showTaxes(value='nominal')\n\nFor the case at hand, recall that asset allocations were selected above through\nplan.setAllocationRatios('individual', generic=[[[60, 40, 0, 0], [70, 30, 0, 0]], [[50, 50, 0, 0], [70, 30, 0, 0]]])\ngliding from a 60%/40% stocks/bonds portfolio to 70%/30% for Jack, and 50%/50% -&gt; 70%/30% for Jill. Assets distribution in all accounts in today’s $ over time can be displayed from\nplan.showAssetDistribution(value='today')\n  \nThese plots are irregular because we used historical rates from 1969. The volatility of the rates offers Roth conversion benefits which are exploited by the optimizer. The rates used can be displayed by:\nplan.showRates()\n\nValues between brackets &lt;&gt; are the average values and volatility over the selected period.\nFor the statisticians, rates distributions and correlations between them can be shown using:\nplan.showRatesCorrelations()\n\nA short text summary of the outcome of the optimization can be displayed through using:\nplan.summary()\nThe output of the last command reports that if future rates are exactly like those observed starting from 1969 and the following years, Jack and Jill could afford an annual spending of \\$97k starting this year (with a basis of \\$88.8k - the basis multiplies the profile which can vary over the course of the plan). The summary also contains some details:\nSUMMARY ================================================================\nNet yearly spending basis in 2025$: $91,812\nNet yearly spending for year 2025: $100,448\nNet spending remaining in year 2025: $100,448\nTotal net spending in 2025$: $2,809,453 ($7,757,092 nominal)\nTotal Roth conversions in 2025$: $320,639 ($456,454 nominal)\nTotal income tax paid on ordinary income in 2025$: $247,788 ($469,522 nominal)\nTotal tax paid on gains and dividends in 2025$: $3,313 ($3,768 nominal)\nTotal Medicare premiums paid in 2025$: $117,660 ($343,388 nominal)\nSpousal wealth transfer from Jack to Jill in year 2051 (nominal): taxable: $0  tax-def: $57,224  tax-free: $2,102,173\nSum of spousal bequests to Jill in year 2051 in 2025$: $499,341 ($2,159,397 nominal)\nPost-tax non-spousal bequests from Jack in year 2051 (nominal): taxable: $0  tax-def: $0  tax-free: $0\nSum of post-tax non-spousal bequests from Jack in year 2051 in 2025$: $0 ($0 nominal)\nPost-tax account values at the end of final plan year 2057 (nominal): taxable: $0  tax-def: $0  tax-free: $2,488,808\nTotal estate value at the end of final plan year 2057 in 2025$: $500,000 ($2,488,808 nominal)\nPlan starting date: 01-01\nCumulative inflation factor from start date to end of plan: 4.98\n        Jack's 27-year life horizon: 2025 -&gt; 2051\n        Jill's 33-year life horizon: 2025 -&gt; 2057\nPlan name: jack & jill - tutorial\nNumber of decision variables: 996\nNumber of constraints: 867\nCase executed on: 2025-02-04 at 22:55:03\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd an Excel workbook can be saved with all the detailed amounts over the years by using the following command:\nplan.saveWorkbook(overwrite=True)\nFor Monte Carlo simulations, the mean return rates, their volatility and covariance are specified and used to generate random scenarios. A histogram of outcomes is generated such as this one for Jack and Jill, which was generated by selecting stochastic rates and using\nplan.runMC('maxSpending', ...)\n\nSimilarly, the next one was generated using\nplan.runMC('maxBequest', ...)\n\nSee tutorial notebooks 1, 2, and 3 for more info."

Package odfpy might be required if one read files created by LibreOffice. These dependencies will be installed by pip using the installation guide here..\nThe simplest way to get started with Owl is to use the streamlit browser-based user interface that is started by the owlplanner.cmd script, which will start a user interface on your own browser. Here is a screenshot of one of the multiple tabs of the interface:\n\nAlternatively, one can prefer using Owl from Jupyter notebooks. For that purpose, the examples directory contains many files as a tutorial. The Jupyter Notebook interface is a browser-based application for authoring documents that combines live-code with narrative text, equations and visualizations. Jupyter will run in your default web browser, from your computer to your browser, and therefore no data is ever transferred on the Internet (your computer, i.e., localhost, is the server).\nFor simulating your own realizations, use the files beginning with the word template. Make a copy and rename them with your own names while keeping the same extension. Then you’ll be able to personalize a case with your own numbers and start experimenting with Owl. Notebooks with detailed explanations can be found in tutorial_1, tutorial_2, and tutorial_3.\nFinally, you will also need the capability to read and edit Excel files. One can have an Excel license, or use the LibreOffice free alternative. You can also use Google docs.\nCopyright © 2024 - Martin-D. Lacasse\nDisclaimers: I am not a financial planner.

    "text": "Purpose and vision\nOne goal of Owl is to provide a free and open-source ecosystem that has cutting-edge optimization capabilities, allowing for the next generation of Python-literate retirees to experiment with their own financial future while providing a codebase where they can learn and contribute. At the same time, an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface based on Streamlit allows a broad set of users to benefit from the application as it only requires basic financial knowledge.\nThere are and were good retirement optimizers in the recent past, but the vast majority of them are either proprietary platforms collecting your data, or academic papers that share the results without really sharing the details of the underlying mathematical models. The algorithms in Owl rely on the open-source HiGHS linear programming solver but they have also been ported and tested on other platforms such as Mosek and COIN-OR. The complete formulation and detailed description of the underlying mathematical model can be found here.\nIt is anticipated that most end users will use Owl through the graphical interface either at owlplanner.streamlit.app or installed on their own computer. The underlying Python package can also be used directly through Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks as described here.\nA separate installation guide is available for OWL on WSL using UV.\nNot every retirement decision strategy can be framed as an easy-to-solve optimization problem. In particular, if one is interested in comparing different withdrawal strategies, FI Calc is an elegant application that addresses this need. If, however, you also want to optimize spending, bequest, and Roth conversions, with an approach also considering Medicare and federal income tax over the next few years, then Owl is definitely a tool that can help guide your decisions."

    "section": "Capabilities",
    "text": "Capabilities\nOwl can optimize for either maximum net spending under the constraint of a given bequest (which can be zero), or maximize the after-tax value of a bequest under the constraint of a desired net spending profile, and under the assumption of a heirs marginal tax rate.\nRoth conversions are also considered, subject to an optional maximum conversion amount, and optimized to suit the goals of the selected objective function.\nAll calculations are indexed for inflation, which is either provided as a fixed rate, or through historical values, as are all other rates used for the calculations. These rates can be used for backtesting different scenarios by choosing historical rates, or by choosing historical average rates over a historical year range, or what I coined “histochastic” rates which are generated using the statistical distribution of observed historical rates.\nPortfolios available for experimenting include assets from the S&P 500, Corporate Bonds Baa, Treasury 10-y Notes, and cash assets assumed to just follow inflation which is represented by the Consumer Price Index. Other asset classes can easily be added, but would add complexity while only providing diminishing insights.\nHistorical data used are from Aswath Damodaran at the Stern School of Business.\nAsset allocations are selected for the duration of the plan, and these can glide linearly or along a configurable s-curve over the lifespan of the individual.\nSpending profiles are adjusted for inflation, and so are all other indexable quantities. Proflies can be flat or follow a smile curve which is also adjustable through three simple parameters.\n\nAvailable rates are from 1928 to last year and can be used to test historical performance.\nFixed rates can also be provided, as well as histochastic rates, which are generated using the statistical characteristics (means and covariance matrix) of a selected historical year range.\nPure stochastic rates can also be generated if the user provides means, volatility (expressed as standard deviation), and optionally the correlations between the different assets return rates provided as a matrix, or a list of the off-diagonal elements (see documentation for details).\nAverage rates calculated over a historical data period can also be chosen.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations capabilities are included and provide a probability of success and a histogram of outcomes. These simulations can be used for either determining the probability distribution of the maximum net spending amount under the constraint of a desired bequest, or the probability distribution of the maximum bequest under the constraint of a desired net spending amount.\nUnlike discrete-event simulators, Owl uses an optimization algorithm for every new scenario, which results in more calculations being performed. As a result, the number of cases to be considered should be kept to a reasonable number. For a few hundred cases, a few minutes of calculations can provide very good estimates and reliable probability distributions.\nOptimizing each solution is more representative than event-base simulators in the sense that optimal solutions will naturally adjust to the return scenarios being considered. This is more realistic as retirees would certainly re-evaluate their expectations under severe market drops or gains. This optimal approach provides a net benefit over event-based simulators, which maintain a distribution strategy either fixed, or within guardrails for capturing the retirees’ reactions to the market.\nBasic input parameters can be entered through the user interface while optional additional time series can be read from an Excel spreadsheet that contains future wages, contributions to savings accounts, and planned big-ticket items such as the purchase of a lake house, the sale of a boat, large gifts, or inheritance.\nThree types of savings accounts are considered: taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free, which are all tracked separately for married individuals. Asset transition to the surviving spouse is done according to beneficiary fractions for each type of savings account. Tax status covers married filing jointly and single, depending on the number of individuals reported.\nMaturation rules for Roth contributions and conversions are implemented as constraints limiting withdrawal amounts to cover Roth account balances for 5 years after the events. Medicare and IRMAA calculations are performed through a self-consistent loop on cash flow constraints. They can also be optimized explicitly as an option, but this choice can lead to longer calculations due to the use of the many additional binary variables required by the formulation. Future Medicare and IRMAA values are simple projections of current values with the assumed inflation rates.\nOwl has a basic social security calculator that determines the actual benefits based on the individual’s primary insurance amount (PIA), full retirement age (FRA), and claiming age. Both spousal’s benefits and survivor’s benefits are calculated for non-complex cases."

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\nOwl is work in progress. At the current time:\n\nOnly the US federal income tax is considered (and minimized through the optimization algorithm). Head of household filing status has not been added but can easily be.\nRequired minimum distributions are calculated, but tables for spouses more than 10 years apart are not included. These cases are detected and will generate an error message.\nCurrent version has no optimization of asset allocations between individuals and/or types of savings accounts. If there is interest, that could be added in the future.\nIn the current implementation, social securiy is always taxed at 85%, assuming that your taxable income will be larger than 34 k$ (single) or 44 k$ (married filing jointly).\nWhen Medicare calculations are done through a self-consistent loop, the Medicare premiums are calculated after an initial solution is generated, and then a new solution is re-generated with these premiums as a constraint. In some situations, when the income (MAGI) is near an IRMAA bracket, oscillatory solutions can arise. While the solutions generated are very close to one another, Owl will pick the smallest solution for being conservative. While sometimes computationally costly, a comparison with a full Medicare optimization should always be performed.\nPart D is not included in the IRMAA calculations. Only Part B is taken into account, which is considerably more significant.\nFuture tax brackets are pure speculations derived from the little we know now and projected to the next 30 years. Your guesses are as good as mine.\n\nThe solution from an optimization algorithm has only two states: feasible and infeasible. Therefore, unlike event-driven simulators that can tell you that your distribution strategy runs out of money in year 20, an optimization-based solver can only tell you that a solution does or does not exist for the plan being considered. Examples of infeasible solutions include requesting a bequeathed estate value too large for the savings assets to support, even with zero net spending basis, or maximizing the bequest subject to a net spending basis that is already too large for the savings assets to support, even with no estate being left."
