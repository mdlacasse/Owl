    "This package is a retirement modeling framework for exploring the sensitivity of retirement financial decisions. Strictly speaking, it is not a planning tool, but more an environment for exploring *what if* scenarios. It provides different realizations of a financial strategy. One can certainly have a savings plan, but due to the volatility of financial investments, it is impossible to have a certain asset earnings plan. This does not mean one cannot make decisions. These decisions need to be guided with an understanding of the sensitivity of the parameters.This is exactly where this tool fits it. Given your savings and spending desires, it can generate different future realizations of your strategy under different market assumptions, helping to better understand your financial situation.\n",

    "The most manageable part of retirement planning is the control one has over work income, contributions to savings accounts, Roth conversions, and other big spending items in the near- and mid-term future.\n",
    "In order to execute a realization, one must provide an earning, saving, and Roth conversion plan. This is done through providing an Excel workbook with one spreadsheet (tab) per spouse with the following information:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, 20XX is the last row which could be the last year based on the life expectancy values provided. Missing years will be filled with empty values. For the columns, *anticipated wages* is the annual amount (gross minus tax-deferred contributions) that you anticipate to receive from employment or other sources (not including dividends from your taxable investment accounts). Note that column names are case sensitive and all of these entries must be in lower case. Best way to start this process is to use the template provided rightly named *template.xlsx*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this exercise, there is no clear definition of retirement age. There will be a year, however, from which you will stop having anticipated income, or diminished income due to decreasing your work load. This transition can be gradual or sudden. Therefore there is no need to enter a retirement age for the sole purpose of quantifying your financial future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions to your savings accounts are marked as *ctrb*. Contributions to your 401k must also include your employer's contributions, if any. As this file is in Excel, one can use the native calculator to enter a percentage of the anticipated wages for contributions as this can sometimes be easier. Considering a specific example, assume that Jack earns 100k\\\\$ and contributes 5% to his 401k which his employer matches at up to 4%, then Jack's anticipated wages will be $(1-.05)*100000 = 95000$ and his 401k contributions will be $.09/(1 - .05) * 95000 = 9000 $. \n",
    "\n",
    "Roth conversion are specified in the column marked *Roth conv*. Roth conversion are typically performed in the years when the income is lower (and therefore lower tax rates), typically in the bridge years between having a full-time regular salary and collecting social security. This column is provided to override the Roth conversion optimization in Owl. When the solver is given the option `maxConversion='file'`, then these values will be used and no optimization over Roth conversions will be performed. This column is provided for flexibility and allowing comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, *big-ticket items* are used for accounting for the sale or purchase of a house, or any other major expense or money that you would give or receive (e.g., inheritance, or large gifts to or from you). Therefore, the sign (+/-) of entries in this column is important. Positive numbers will be considered in the cash flow for the year and surplus will be deposited in taxable savings accounts. Negative numbers will generate withdrawals and distributions from retirement accounts. This is the only column that can contain negative numbers: all other column entries should be positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tab name for each spreadsheet represents the name of the spouse for reporting yearly transactions affecting the plan. There has to be one tab for each individual and bearing the same name. Therefore, you need to rename these tabs to have the same names as those used to create the plan (i.e., *Jack* and *Jill* in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the (free) LibreOffice software can be used if you do not have an Excel license, as LibreOffice can read and save `.xlsx` files. Moreover, the native file format from the LibreOffice software can also be read directly. However, you will have to install the `odfpy` package through `conda install conda-forge::odfpy` first."

A *smile* profile accounts for the fact that your spending capacity will modulate during retirement as you go from the so-called gogo years to the no-go years.
