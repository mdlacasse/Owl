    "This package is a retirement modeling framework for exploring the sensitivity of retirement financial decisions. Strictly speaking, it is not a planning tool, but more an environment for exploring *what if* scenarios. It provides different realizations of a financial strategy. One can certainly have a savings plan, but due to the volatility of financial investments, it is impossible to have a certain asset earnings plan. This does not mean one cannot make decisions. These decisions need to be guided with an understanding of the sensitivity of the parameters.This is exactly where this tool fits it. Given your savings and spending desires, it can generate different future realizations of your strategy under different market assumptions, helping to better understand your financial situation.\n",

    "In Owl, there are two mechanisms that can be used to generate random series of return rates for performing statistical analysis. The first one is to pick a range of historical returns and to derive statistics out of these values. This is achieved by using what I coined the *histochastic* method that is called as follows:\n",

    "The means and covariance matrix calculated from this time series are then used to generate a series with similar characteristics. Note that the mathematical model used assumes that the rates follow a normal distribution which is a known incorrect approximation. This implies that the distribution of events in the tails might be slightly incorrect but for the time being, there is no known distribution that will capture the tails more accurately. The mean values however, are more robust to our choice of distribution, due to a averaging effect known as the central limit theorem. \n",

It can be turned back on using 'withMedicare' to `True` in the options, but this will significantly increase (about 3X) the computing time while providing little more insight.
