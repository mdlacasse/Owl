    "This package is a retirement modeling framework for exploring the sensitivity of retirement financial decisions. Strictly speaking, it is not a planning tool, but more an environment for exploring *what if* scenarios. It provides different realizations of a financial strategy. One can certainly have a savings plan, but due to the volatility of financial investments, it is impossible to have a certain asset earnings plan. This does not mean one cannot make decisions. These decisions need to be guided with an understanding of the sensitivity of the parameters.This is exactly where this tool fits it. Given your savings and spending desires, it can generate different future realizations of your strategy under different market assumptions, helping to better understand your financial situation.\n",

    "*Partial* is the post-tax partial bequest left to individuals others than Jill at the passing of Jack, in that case, Jack's children. The range of values obtained in solutions is also reported as well as the number of solutions with 0 as an answer. The amount that Jack leaves to his children can vary from \\\\$0 to about \\\\$1 M, and shows the largest variability, explaining the large difference between the median and the average. Mean values are indicated by $\\bar{x}$. What strikes here the the number of solutions which have Jack's account depleted. We will discuss these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all cases are successful at leaving a \\\\$200k final bequest, but the net spending required for achieving this constraint can lead to small values in some scenarios. However, the median value $M$ for net spending is about \\\\$88k, very close to the \\\\$90k desired by Jack and Jill. Recall that we are using a more conservative return of 8%, with a volatility of 17% for the S&P 500. It is therefore natural that the number we find here is slightly lower than what the historical returns of the market have been observed to provide. Some of these scenarios will yield more than the median, but some others will require a net spending of less than \\\\$50k. All these scenarios make a probability of close to 100\\% for leaving a \\\\$200k bequest at Jill's passing as requested. This is in addition to a median of about \\\\$20k left at Jack's passing. We can see that the mean value left by Jack to his children is around \\\\$130k while the median is much lower, due to many scenarios depleting Jack's account at his passing. What is to note is that several scenarios deplete Jack's account to reduce the partial bequest in view of maximizing the net spending. This is the action of the optimization working to maximize its objective function, which  is the net spending in this particular case. That is, the optimizer will select scenarios where the net spending will be increased at the expense of decreasing the partial bequest. What can potentially still hold money in Jack's account and allow to provide a partial bequest is the restriction imposed by satisfying a certain spending profile which limits the depletion of the accounts. That is, more gains can be realized in certain scenarios that the ability to spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of success might be misleading here as this is the number of cases for which a solution was found, regardless of the optimal value for a net spending basis. A more useful information would consist of the fraction of all solutions larger than a value $x$. This value can be derived from the histogram on the right. This would give an estimate of the probability of having a net spending larger than $x$ conditional to delivering a final bequest of \\\\$200k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, one can look at the maximum bequest left at Jill's passing under the constraint of a net spending starting at \\$80k this year (obviously in today's money). This is what the next case will do."

A success rate larger than 85% is considered relatively good, especially considering the fact that Jack and Jill are always able to re-adjust their net spending plan as other forward-looking estimates are performed in the future, and that the partial bequest left to Jack's children is a percentage, not an absolute quantity.
