    "This package is a retirement modeling framework for exploring the sensitivity of retirement financial decisions. Strictly speaking, it is not a planning tool, but more an environment for exploring *what if* scenarios. It provides different realizations of a financial strategy. One can certainly have a savings plan, but due to the volatility of financial investments, it is impossible to have a certain asset earnings plan. This does not mean one cannot make decisions. These decisions need to be guided with an understanding of the sensitivity of the parameters.This is exactly where this tool fits it. Given your savings and spending desires, it can generate different future realizations of your strategy under different market assumptions, helping to better understand your financial situation.\n",

    "The most manageable part of retirement planning is the control one has over work income, contributions to savings accounts, Roth conversions, and other big spending items in the near- and mid-term future.\n",
    "In order to execute a realization, one must provide an earning, saving, and optionally a Roth conversion plan for overriding the optimizer. This is done through providing an Excel workbook with one spreadsheet (tab) per spouse with the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "|year|anticipated wages|taxable ctrb | 401k ctrb | Roth 401k ctrb | IRA ctrb | Roth IRA ctrb | Roth conv | big-ticket items|\n",

    "| ... | | | | | | | | |\n",
    "|20XX | | | | | | | | |\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, 20XX is the last row which could be the last year based on the life expectancy values provided. Missing years will be filled with empty values. For the columns, *anticipated wages* is the annual amount (gross minus tax-deferred contributions) that you anticipate to receive from employment or other sources (not including dividends from your taxable investment accounts). Note that column names are case sensitive and all of these entries must be in lower case. Best way to start this process is to use the template file provided rightly named *template.xlsx*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this exercise, there is no clear definition of retirement age. There will be a year, however, from which you will stop having anticipated income, or diminished income due to decreasing your work load. This transition can be gradual or sudden. Therefore there is no need to enter a retirement age for the sole purpose of quantifying your financial future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions to your savings accounts are marked as *ctrb*. We use 401k as a term which includes contributions to 403b as well. Contributions to your 401k/403b must also include your employer's contributions, if any. As this file is in Excel, one can use the native calculator to enter a percentage of the anticipated wages for contributions as this can sometimes be easier. Considering a specific example, assume that Jack earns 100k\\\\$ and contributes 5% to his 401k which his employer matches at up to 4%, then Jack's anticipated wages will be $(1-.05)*100000 = 95000$ and his 401k contributions will be $.09/(1 - .05) * 95000 = 9000 $. The reason for using $95000$ in the last equation allows for making cross-reference between the cells, as the number 100k\\\\$ will not appear directly. Another approach could be to use an additional column with for the total salary and derive numbers from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roth conversion are specified in the column marked *Roth conv*. Roth conversion are typically performed in the years when the income is lower (and therefore lower tax rates), typically in the bridge years between having a full-time regular salary and collecting social security. This column is provided to override the Roth conversion optimization in Owl. When the solver is given the option `maxConversion='file'`, then these values will be used and no optimization over Roth conversions will be performed. This column is provided for flexibility and allowing comparisons between an optimized solution and your best guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, *big-ticket items* are used for accounting for the sale or purchase of a house, or any other major expense or money that you would give or receive (e.g., inheritance, or large gifts to or from you). Therefore, the sign (+/-) of entries in this column is important. Positive numbers will be considered in the cash flow for the year and surplus, if any, will be deposited in the taxable savings accounts. Negative numbers will potentially generate additional withdrawals and distributions from retirement accounts. This is the only column that can contain negative numbers: all other column entries should be positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tab name for each spreadsheet represents the name of the spouse for reporting yearly transactions affecting the plan. There has to be one tab for each individual and bearing the same name. Therefore, when running your own case, you will need to rename the tabs in the template file to have the same names as those used to create the plan (i.e., *Jack* and *Jill* in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the (free) LibreOffice software can be used if you do not have an Excel license, as LibreOffice can read and save `.xlsx` files. Moreover, the native file format from the LibreOffice software can also be read directly. However, you will have to install the `odfpy` package through `conda install conda-forge::odfpy` first."

    "For determining the desirable annual net spending in retirement, certified planners will strongly suggest that you've must have already done a cash flow analysis on your yearly spending. After this exercise, you should have a good idea of how much you'll need in retirement. Another approach is to experiment with multiple spending scenarios and see what your current and future savings can sustain under different market conditions. As one nears retirement, both approaches will need to meet at one point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The desired spending defined here is the minimum annual **net** spending income (i.e., after paying federal income tax and Medicare) that one would like to receive starting at her/his \"retirement age\" (we provided a loose definition of the term *retirement age* above). This desired spending must be adjusted for inflation and can follow an additional adjustment called a *smile* profile. A *smile* profile accounts for the fact that your spending capacity will modulate during retirement as you go from the so-called gogo years to the no-go years. A *flat* profile, on the other hand, will keep the same value, which will only be adjusted for inflation. More realistically, the income could also be modulated by the performance of assets, reducing withdrawals in market down years. Some of these strategies (first proposed by Guyton and Klinger) could be implemented in Owl.\n",
    "\n",
    "These profiles are multipliers to a spending amount to be set, or obtained from an optimization. For example, a flat profile for a single individual would be unity ($1$) for the whole duration of the plan. In contrast, a smile profile would start at a value larger than $1$ and then decrease over the years to a value smaller than unity, then to go above unity toward the end of the plan. The actual spending amount will be determined either by optimization (for `maxSpending`) or be provided by the user (for `maxBequest`). The final spending amount is a *basis* multiplied by the profile. The basis and the net spending amount are the same for a flat profile, but will differ for a *smile* profile.\n",

    "Valid choices are *historical*, *histochastic*, *historical average*, *user*, *conservative*, *stochastic*, or *default*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the S&P 500 rates provided always include dividends, which are assumed to be reinvested, while the rates for inflation are\n",
    "derived from the urban consumer price index.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fixed rates\n",
    "For the *optimistic* case, values reported from MorningStar for the next ten years are used. It is selected by using this call:\n",
    "\n",
    "    plan.setRates('optimistic')\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conservative* rates are lower than the last ten years as most analysts are predicting lower rates from the next decade. These values are fixed rates of 6.0% for the S&P 500, 4.0% for the Corporate bonds markets, 3.5% for the 10-year Treasury notes, with an inflation at around 2.8%. Using these conservative rates can be achieved by using the following call:\n",
    "\n",
    "    plan.setRates('conservative')\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also use user-provided annual rates by providing a list of 4 entries in percent as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    myrates = [9.6, 4.0, 3.0, 3.8]\n",
    "    plan.setRates('user', values=myrates)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This example would use fixed rates of 9.6%, 4.0%, 3.0%, and 3.8% as average annual returns on S&P 500, corporate bonds, Treasury notes, and common assets, respectively, with an average annual inflation rate of 3.8% for the full duration of the time simulation. Recall that the common assets class consists of investments tracking inflation only. Therefore the last index serves both to track the common asset class and to adjust values for inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, rates can also be set to fixed values obtained from an average over a time interval using the *historical average* option. For example, the call\n",
    "\n",
    "    plan.setRates('historical average', 1990, 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "would set the rates to constant values being the average observed from 1990 to 2020 inclusively. The word 'means' can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable rates\n",
    "For the *historical*, *histochastic*, and *historical average* options, data from 1928 to the last year are available for experimenting.\n",
    "Ranges chosen smaller than the life horizon of the longest-lived individual will have rate values repeated in cycle. For example,\n",
    "choosing historical data from 1994 to (up and including) 1996 will repeat these three values over the time span of the realization.\n",
    "This would be called as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    plan.setRates('historical', 1994, 1996)\n",
    "\n",
    "This case is only provided as an explanatory example, as it would have little practical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the upper bound is not provided as the third argument, then the latest data year (i.e., last year) will be assumed by default.\n",
    "If one chooses a historical range starting from 1970, Owl will use the rates of 1970 for this year and 1971 for next, etc. This would be selected as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    plan.setRates('historical', 1970)\n",
    "  \n",
    "Due to its particular sequence of rates, the worst-case historical scenario is a retirement starting in 1966. This can be selected as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    plan.setRates('historical', 1966)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the  current year will have the same rates as those that happened in 1966, and next year will have those from 1967, and so on. This choice is given for instructional purposes only. No one should make a plan based on the worst-case historical scenario. Nevertheless, it can be informative to test your own case. In practice, however, a success rate larger than 90% over a reasonable set of historical starting years and market assumptions would be acceptable by a large portion of rational thinkers. But this is all a personal choice. We'll cover how to model multiple starting years below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, one can choose a *histochastic* approach in which case the rates are determined from the multivariate distribution for the 4 rates in the selected year range.  The computed statistical distribution of the selected range of data is used to generate new random rate values. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "    plan.setRates('histochastic', 1945)\n",
    "    \n",
    "will analyze the annual rates from 1945 up to last-year and compute means and covariance to generate new data that are statistically representative of the ones observed during this selected time period. The rates randomly generated for the time span can be plotted and examined as we will see below. Similarly,\n",
    "\n",
    "    plan.setRates('histochastic', 1940, 1970)\n",
    "\n",
    "would generate random rates consistent to those observed during the 1940 - 1970 time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rates can also be generated stochastically by choosing the *stochastic* option.\n",
    "In its simplest case, mean values, and standard deviations (volatility) need to be provided (in percent) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_means = [8, 5, 4, 3]\n",
    "    my_stdev = [17, 8, 8, 2]\n",
    "    p.setRates('stochastic', values=my_means, stdev=my_stdev)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here, we select 8% return on S&P 500 with 17% volatility, 5% return on corporate bonds and and 4% on T-notes, both with 8% volatility, and 3% inflation with 2% of volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Called as shown will assume that there is no correlation between rates of return (in mathematical terms,\n",
    "the correlation matrix defaults to the identity matrix). However, we know that rates are somehow correlated (i.e., when the inflation goes up, returns on bonds tend to go down). To account for this coupling, we\n",
    "can either provide a correlation matrix as here:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    my_means = [8, 5, 4, 3]\n",
    "    my_stdev = [17, 8, 8, 2]\n",
    "    my_corr = [[1, 0.46, 0.06, -.12], [0.46, 1, 0.68, -.27], [0.06, 0.68, 1, -.21], [-.12, -.27, -.21, 1]]\n",
    "    p.setRates('stochastic', values=my_means, stdev=my_stdev, corr=offdiag_corr)\n",
    "\n",
    "or, as the correlation matrix is symmetric, only the 6 off-diagonal elements can be provided and Owl will reconstruct the covariance matrix using these values and the volatility. This is demonstrated here:\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_means = [8, 5, 4, 3]\n",
    "    my_stdev = [17, 8, 8, 2]\n",
    "    offdiag_corr = [.46, .06, -.12, .68, -.27, -.21]\n",
    "    p.setRates('stochastic', values=my_means, stdev=my_stdev, corr=offdiag_corr)\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard matrix notation, the off-diagonal elements of correlation matrix $C$ are $c_{12}, c_{13}, c_{14}, c_{23}, c_{24}, c_{34}$. As $c_{ii} = 1$ and $C$ is symmetric, it can easily be reconstructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an idea of what to expect as correlations, one can use the `getRatesDistributions(from, to)` over a range of\n",
    "years of historical data as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    means, stdev, corr, covar = owl.getRatesDistributions(1970, 2019)\n",
